# NpsychAssessmentTool: UDS Battery Scores in Interactive Tables and Figures

Building on the NpsychBatteryNorms package, this package includes a
Shiny application that makes it easy to present UDS battery scores in a
way useful to consensus diagnosis. Data can be imported as an .csv file
or pulled directly from a REDCap database (\`REDCapR\` needed).
