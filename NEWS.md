# NpsychAssessmentTool (development version)

* Added the ability to pull biomarker data directly from the Panda database (UW ADRC specific)

* The part of the UI that handles the plots now uses an accordion. This lets the user collapse panels with plots that are not of interest for less clutter. 

* Added the option to download the main assessment table.

# NpsychAssessmentTool 0.1.0

* Initial version shared with WADRC
